 * NOTES:
 * This part of the project covers prime generation. Primes will be generated in
 * different manners depending on the parameters of the situation.
 * 
 * The prime section of this project (bf-prime.c/h) can be considered it's own
 * little sub project and used on it's own for other purposes.  I might 
 * consider forking it out later and giving it a single repo.
