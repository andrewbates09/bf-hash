bf-hash
=======

Another hashing algorithm. In the words of a great mind in computer science, "don't even ask why."

The idea of this project is to create an efficient, multi-purpose string hashing function. That may be misleading, multi-purpose in that it can be used for different size projects, few hashes and lots of hashes, so I suppose a better term might be adaptable.

If you know case size for using this hash table, you can include a size of how big you think the table of values will get, in the initialization of the map.
